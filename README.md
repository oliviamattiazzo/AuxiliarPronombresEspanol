### What was it? :thought_balloon:
Two contexts mixed together: First, I'm obsessed with learning new idioms and I'm currently having Spanish classes, but I absolutely hate to keep writing (or copying and pasting) the pronouns to conjugate the verbs.
So I thought: I can do something to help me.

Second, I started studying Javascript through [this course](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/javascript-es6-orientacao-a-objetos-parte-1) and I really would like to apply the knowledge I acquired into a new project; on a project I could evolve by myself, not only from the classes.

I mixed these two contexts and boom: here it is!

### Is it published? How can I use it? :arrow_forward:

### Credits :raising_hand:
Hi there! My name is Olivia. I'm a web developer, focused on Microsoft technologies (.NET/C# are my favorites). I'm trying to learn more about Javascript because I feel it's really important to a backend career (and it's fun too, even though I'm struggling a lot with it :sleepy:).

Feel free to contact me with any questions, tips or feedbacks about this project. I'll be happy to hear and to reply!
